# MSAAI-530-Final-Project
**Smart EV Charging Network Optimization System**

**Project Overview**

The Smart EV Charging Network Optimization System is a machine learning-driven IoT solution designed to enhance the efficiency of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. This project utilizes deep learning classification to predict charging speeds and time series forecasting (LSTM) to estimate future energy demand.By analyzing real-world EV charging data, our system optimizes station resource allocation, improves user experience, and enhances energy distribution strategies.
